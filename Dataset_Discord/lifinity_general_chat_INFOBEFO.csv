9,926250365060534292,"So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695,2021-12-30T23:08:15.930000+00:00

147,926173250118115429,"This is my take

So the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695,2021-12-30T18:01:50.295000+00:00

There will ALWAYS be fees from the lp pool to buy the nfts regardless of the fees from nft sales.

This integration with Jupiter is massive. As lifinity fees are lowest out there at 0.15% anytime anyone hits Jupiter to trade it should hit lifinity being the lowest fees and always having the liquidity available by it's design to concentrate liquidity. 

Pretty much anyone I know on solana is using Jupiter by default now as it checks over 400 routes to get you the user the best price.

313,926126199346966529,"This is my take



So the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695,2021-12-30T14:54:52.517000+00:00

Floor that is bought back goes into holdings for the DAO made of NFT holders. The DAO decides what is done with the nfts that are bought back. This increases the amount of tokens that each nft is entitled too by taking some out of circulation. We also get to decide what to do with these nfts e.g. maybe the DAO later on decides to resell them or burn them or smtg along those lines. Utility is NOT just the token drops.

8480,925022334635610173,"Here is my take on the nft price, most of the people that minted are not looking to sell anytime soon, nor do they care about the price of the nft. Its all about the revenue that those nfts will generate over the year +! There is a reason somebody bought 1150 of them and didn't flip 12h later for 3x. If anything, we should be happy price stays reasonable and that causes people to buy and sell which generates royalties that go directly to pool and buybacks. So i guess what I'm saying is there are 2 games being played, somebody wants to flip for a short term gains, and somebody is not even looking at ME. Most nfts are not going to be sold anytime soon, so this obsession with floor being at 4 or 8 SOL is mostly irrelevant for now.",393496265796747264,2021-12-27T13:48:30.661000+00:00

Floor is market sentiment and a couple of tweets taken out of context severely impact it. 
Read about the project, make your own assessment and then decide whether to exit or stick with it. You are all at profit, go exit or stay. The project has received the seed they required. Its an AMM , in all honesty they wont be impacted by the floor

"" People do not understand this enough. DEX is
a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep
paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other
DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides
concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very
soon be able to expand to many other trading
pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which
solves the problem of the massive value leak
from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an
enormous amount of money for the protocol
and will only get more obvious when it expands
to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised
High Frequency Market Maker at the same
time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto
Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at
the same time, hence making both the trading
fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread.
Think of the protocol being a decentralised
version of FTX and Alameda Research at the
same time. These are some of the most
profitable businesses in crypto, and now there
is a decentralised version which we can own as

14134,924845751572516930,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.",917977969379672095,2021-12-27T02:06:49.978000+00:00

14189,924845033683845120,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.",893864466209460224,2021-12-27T02:03:58.820000+00:00
