515,931419981827158046,"This was designed for audio only, so I wouldn't recommend using it as is, but here you go:

Lifinity Protocol is a proactive market maker designed to improve capital efficiency and reduce impermanent loss.
Let me give a basic explanation of how it does that.

1. Concentrating liquidity

One way to think about what we do is that its similar to stableswaps such as Mercurial or Saber, for asset pairs such as USDC/USDT. 
They can do this because the relative price between the assets is known. 
For example, 1 USDC should always be worth 1 USDT. 
But this isn‚Äôt true for SOL/USDC, for example, because the price of SOL in terms of USDC is constantly changing. 

2. Proactively market make using oracles

It‚Äôs like having a Uni v3 position, but that position is automatically adjusted to follow the price given by an oracle. 
This a great from a UX perspective because users don‚Äôt need to constantly adjust their positions manually.
The protocol does the adjusting for you. 
Additionally, it reduces or even reverses IL because we buy and sell at the true price rather than a price that is purely based the current composition of assets in our pool.

3. Implementing a rebalancing mechanism

If pool unbalanced and isn‚Äôt 50/50, the AMM will adjust prices in such a way that it encourages traders to balance the pool.",324695454304567297,2022-01-14T05:30:28.614000+00:00

545,931319180706349067,"3 main differences below as I understand it

1- 50x concentrated liquidity compared to constant function AMMs like Raydium/Uniswap V2 so way more trades, more efficient so more fees. 
Lifinity can get up to 50x liquidity from the same lp pool than a traditional AMM like Raydium or Uniswap V2 can. The benefit of this is we can attract multiple times more trades and earn many times more fees than others from the same value of staked liquidity in our pools. Lifinity does this using a price oracle (pyth) which basically takes the price of any asset pair in real time and transfers it on chain so we know exactly where to put the liquidity. Traditional AMMs don't use an oracle so they simply spread the liquidity much more thinly across the entire range of all possible prices so its not deep like lifinity and if a pair goes up or down quickly the liquidity is used up. 

2- Massively reduce Impermanent loss which is the No1 killer for most lp pools. Even possible to turn Impermanent loss into Impermanent gain!

3- Clever Pool rebalancing mechanism. As price of any pair is coming onchain via an oracle the algorithm adjusts price of imbalanced assets during large moves to encourage trading of that asset hence balance is achieved. A balanced pool with concentrated liquidity aggregated on Jupiter shud generate a ton of fees",810247348802289695,2022-01-13T22:49:55.754000+00:00

I think the concentrated liquidity vs traditional AMM constant function k=y√óx whereby liquidity is spread needs almost a worked out and learned off description with clear example to really help the general audience get it. As most wont know uniswap V2 & V3 & how they work.

So it's kinda like write it in 3 or 4 sentences for dummies and then read it / learn it so always only one way to describe it.

Same for impermanent gain and rebalancing. 2 or 3 written down sentences inc examples that dummies will get it.

2353,929021168130879538,"Did some back of the envelope math about what the lifinity IDO could look like if it was structured like the mango IDO. It will definitely not be like this but this is a model for what it COULD look like for flare holders.

1% of 10,000,000,000 for flare holders would be 100,000,000.
That split between flare holders is 10,000 per flare. If the tokenomics are the same that would be 5% to devs 5% available to public (4% IDO sale 1% to flare holders) that would mean 20% of the initial available supply would go to flare holders.(This number doesn‚Äôt include any flares bought back by the bot that would increase the number of tokens/flare). It will almost certainly not play out like this but as holders our initial reward could be really great. Lifinity also isn‚Äôt going to need to mine liquidity with outrageous APYs that kill the token price long term. We‚Äôll also most likely have a fairly large influence on decisions in the DAO holding such a large percentage of the tokens.",804501326977433672,2022-01-07T14:38:26.861000+00:00
