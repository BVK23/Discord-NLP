514,931419981827158046,"This was designed for audio only, so I wouldn't recommend using it as is, but here you go:

Lifinity Protocol is a proactive market maker designed to improve capital efficiency and reduce impermanent loss.
Let me give a basic explanation of how it does that.

1. Concentrating liquidity

One way to think about what we do is that its similar to stableswaps such as Mercurial or Saber, for asset pairs such as USDC/USDT. 
They can do this because the relative price between the assets is known. 
For example, 1 USDC should always be worth 1 USDT. 
But this isn‚Äôt true for SOL/USDC, for example, because the price of SOL in terms of USDC is constantly changing. 

2. Proactively market make using oracles

It‚Äôs like having a Uni v3 position, but that position is automatically adjusted to follow the price given by an oracle. 
This a great from a UX perspective because users don‚Äôt need to constantly adjust their positions manually.
The protocol does the adjusting for you. 
Additionally, it reduces or even reverses IL because we buy and sell at the true price rather than a price that is purely based the current composition of assets in our pool.

3. Implementing a rebalancing mechanism

If pool unbalanced and isn‚Äôt 50/50, the AMM will adjust prices in such a way that it encourages traders to balance the pool.",324695454304567297

544,931319180706349067,"3 main differences below as I understand it

1- 50x concentrated liquidity compared to constant function AMMs like Raydium/Uniswap V2 so way more trades, more efficient so more fees. 
Lifinity can get up to 50x liquidity from the same lp pool than a traditional AMM like Raydium or Uniswap V2 can. The benefit of this is we can attract multiple times more trades and earn many times more fees than others from the same value of staked liquidity in our pools. Lifinity does this using a price oracle (pyth) which basically takes the price of any asset pair in real time and transfers it on chain so we know exactly where to put the liquidity. Traditional AMMs don't use an oracle so they simply spread the liquidity much more thinly across the entire range of all possible prices so its not deep like lifinity and if a pair goes up or down quickly the liquidity is used up. 

2- Massively reduce Impermanent loss which is the No1 killer for most lp pools. Even possible to turn Impermanent loss into Impermanent gain!

3- Clever Pool rebalancing mechanism. As price of any pair is coming onchain via an oracle the algorithm adjusts price of imbalanced assets during large moves to encourage trading of that asset hence balance is achieved. A balanced pool with concentrated liquidity aggregated on Jupiter shud generate a ton of fees",810247348802289695

I think the concentrated liquidity vs traditional AMM constant function k=y√óx whereby liquidity is spread needs almost a worked out and learned off description with clear example to really help the general audience get it. As most wont know uniswap V2 & V3 & how they work.

So it's kinda like write it in 3 or 4 sentences for dummies and then read it / learn it so always only one way to describe it.

Same for impermanent gain and rebalancing. 2 or 3 written down sentences inc examples that dummies will get it.

This shit has taken days for people here on the discord to understand and we are here 24/7. Most of us still probably don't get the impermanent gain aspect üòÄ So what hope do people hearing it for the first time. That's why a scripted  and worked on message may help someway at least cos its difficult shit to explain on the hop.

2081,929449852289577011,Ya that‚Äôs the point is to sell the NFT for a higher price since they (in theory) gain value over the life span of the DEX due to the increase source of income and lowered supply,117403698073698310

My current working theory is Durden actually rolls a dice every time he needs to take a shit, whichever number it lands on he waits that amount of hours before clicking buy on the floor. if its a particularly stinky one he buys 2. The one time the bot bought 3 in a short period of time was following a vindaloo the previous night that didn't agree with his stomach",447648508917317642

2352,929021168130879538,"Did some back of the envelope math about what the lifinity IDO could look like if it was structured like the mango IDO. It will definitely not be like this but this is a model for what it COULD look like for flare holders.

1% of 10,000,000,000 for flare holders would be 100,000,000.
That split between flare holders is 10,000 per flare. If the tokenomics are the same that would be 5% to devs 5% available to public (4% IDO sale 1% to flare holders) that would mean 20% of the initial available supply would go to flare holders.(This number doesn‚Äôt include any flares bought back by the bot that would increase the number of tokens/flare). It will almost certainly not play out like this but as holders our initial reward could be really great. Lifinity also isn‚Äôt going to need to mine liquidity with outrageous APYs that kill the token price long term. We‚Äôll also most likely have a fairly large influence on decisions in the DAO holding such a large percentage of the tokens.",804501326977433672

1% of 10,000,000,000 for flare holders would be 100,000,000.
That split between flare holders is 10,000 per flare. If the tokenomics are the same that would be 5% to devs 5% available to public (4% IDO sale 1% to flare holders) that would mean 20% of the initial available supply would go to flare holders.(This number doesn‚Äôt include any flares bought back by the bot that would increase the number of tokens/flare). It will almost certainly not play out like this but as holders our initial reward could be really great.

3258,928688987328106547,Depends on the reason for doing it. If someone is wash trading they are lowering the floor to accumulate more hence more upside verse losing  money on fees which inevitably goes back into the project too,117403698073698310

If they give up then we unfortunately have to sell possible for .75 If in 3 months the DEX is bringing 1/10ths of raydiums volume (some on calculated) and generate 300-400 sol weekly just focusing on fees. Buyback could be wiping 100-200 flares off the market weekly if paperhands really decided to paper hand. While increasing the number of flares we are buying over time as the DEX brings in more profit, this only implies if paper hands would have a consistent supply and no one saw the potential in the project to hold of course.",117403698073698310

3937,928443650176868413,Yea probably. Buy backs/sweeps will never ever work on solana lol.

So if 1 mil a week of SOL USDC volume traded and pool has 5 mil deposited ( we only own say 2 mil ). The total fees would be 1 mil x .15% x (5/2)

6316,927984786805522512,Oh nice. I don't have wl either,311638008422072321
6317,927984714948677652,yeah I want to but have to wait for the public sale. I'd like to get one if I can. I see them being full of utility because of how they have split the allocation for them and SolSteins similar to SSC (50% token allocation). They already have a live casino hub with loads of volume apparently so seems silly not to.,235804343176003586
6318,927984709198311445,Utility should be available in a couple months for shdw. Will drive the price up further,311638008422072321

6320,927984498384187453,"back to GG, I'm looking forward to more data on the token price over time. It makes it easier to make investment decisions but if it stays way above the IDO price and doesn't look like its pumping in two minutes I'll hold onto it for the long term. If there's a pump and dump in a future day maybe an opportunity to sell and buy back in more token. I don't see why it wouldn't make $100 one day in the next few years. Depends on the crypto market and what that decides to do.",235804343176003586
6321,927984434173587476,Are you guys gonna do quantum traders?,311638008422072321
6322,927983571090677761,Make them 3d models for the metaverse haha,311638008422072321
6323,927983439402119279,I'd vote on more utility for Flares if we can do it. I think it would add more value to the project from a community perspective and make Flares even more desirable. There is a reason everyone wants an SSC. We don't have to do the exact same thing but more utility === more win in my book,235804343176003586
6324,927983128952340481,It's good to see NFTs having utility. Lot of people look down on NFTs cuz they are just jpegs,311638008422072321
6325,927982984420790343,I think the airdrops are associated with your NFT but it sounded like GG said you can sell your NFT with the benefit of them or something. It sounded like you didn't have to unstake your NFT to sell on to the next person which takes into account the price for it with that in mind (or something like that),235804343176003586
6326,927982728010432512,But I did ask <@!324695454304567297> about flare staking. It's definitely not an outright no at the moment. I think ti depends on what we all want to do long term. This is something that none of the analysts of this project can or have captured,235804343176003586
6327,927982621890338877,Thought you had to claim SHDW to unstake,311638008422072321

6334,927982322156961872,<@!311638008422072321> and there's some who'll probably sell their NFT with all the staked token and long term staked value which you can resell if you haven't claimed any of it. Someone will probably do that and make a fortune. But the person buying it holding onto 12k $SHDW for another year or two could still make a lot more,235804343176003586
6335,927982001305309304,I think some people are planning to not stake their NFT to preserve the value and resell. But then the buyer still has to wait 1 year,311638008422072321

6337,927981702415024138,"it wouldn't surprise me if the NFTs gradually lose their value in a year's time once the benefit of the airdrops is all soaked up. Still though, they have achieved their own status. I prefer the design of flares but just my opinion",235804343176003586
6338,927981391998767146,"I think if you wanted to be cautious about 12 months of gradually getting airdropped, having the NFT and pitching into the IDO covers all your bases",235804343176003586

9646,927558653647663134,"When I use serum dex to scalp I am making a better trade for exactly this reason.

When polis launched I did not use swap on raydium. I used DEX as folks looking to sell in any medium size amount cascaded down the liquidity/price point so sold to me at a lower price as liquidity was not concentrated. So they were selling with slippage at a few price points. The DEX had not moved quick enough. 

In this scenario I win as I get a better buy price. Who looses? The person selling as slippage is higher than ideal.

Lifinity with 50x concentrated lp around market price ( from oracle ) should solve this. So in my example above the Lifinity AMM should make this delta that serum DEX was loosing to me.

Now to apply Impermanent loss to the scenario above - its only realised when some leaves the pool. In raydium dex case above if someone left just as I was scalping then they would suffer more IL than they should if it was someone leaving a Lifinity concentrated oracle fed pool.

It can still have losses of course, and it can experience other ""issues"" where there is directional flow and the balance of assets is skewed so it's quoting heavier on one side vs the other around the oracle.

tbh, it's not clear to me it will definitely be better and more stable, but i'm interested to see how it plays out, because in theory this is how a ""dumb"" MM works (just quoting around index price, adjusting size based on inventory etc) -- it just is less dumb than an AMM which is only adjusting price based on trades that occur",136691605020082176

This is precisely it. CPAMM doesn't price its assets optimally. It has no knowledge of the ""true price"". This is in contrast to market makers, which always look at all other markets to determine the true price based on some average. So arbitrageurs make money off of CPAMMs when the price has changed elsewhere. CPAMM sells too low & buys too high, at prices that market makers would not be quoting.",324695454304567297

- A deposits liquidity
- SOL price moves from $200 to $210, arbitrageurs make profit
- SOL price moves from $210 to $200, arbitrageurs make profit
- A withdraws liquidity, made net-profit due to trading fees and no impermanent loss, because price is equal",174614174175854592

9833,927542157240328292,"Here is a a summary I pulled together but advise best do your own DD

Firstly NFT holders get 1% of LFNTY token which will be dropped once a week over 52 weeks to wallets where NFTs are not listed. But the buyback NFTs will not qualify either.

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool so it's fees per trade pumped back into the pool.

So the reward is 0.15% fees of EVERY trade. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

10112,927504662117117952,"Here is a a summary I pulled together but advise best do your own DD

Firstly NFT holders get 1% of LFNTY token which will be dropped once a week over 52 weeks to wallets where NFTs are not listed. But the buyback NFTs will not qualify either.

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool so it's fees per trade pumped back into the pool.

So the reward is 0.15% fees of EVERY trade. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

10716,927271482206326784,It's my understanding they only buy flares under mint price. Correct?,311638008422072321
10717,927267838861922314,"I think so too. Especially when you crunch the numbers and it gets only near Orca's mSOLUSDC volume, the revenue from the fees is quite good. And Flares will get more expensive, so probably a lot less trading with them",726742117627723827
10718,927267127784792075,It will become the primary driver and secondary sales of the flares on the markets will become less of a factor and driving force for price appreciation of the flares.,384731134682071041

11930,926991759907639326,"Here is a a summary I pulled together but advise best do your own DD

Firstly NFT holders get 1% of LFNTY token which will be dropped once a week over 52 weeks to wallets where NFTs are not listed. But the buyback NFTs will not qualify either.

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool so it's fees per trade pumped back into the pool.

So the reward is 0.15% fees of EVERY trade. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

13100,926768220814344273,"Firstly NFT holders get 1% of LFNTY token which will be dropped once a week over 52 weeks to wallets where NFTs are not listed. But the buyback NFTs will not qualify either.

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool so it's fees per trade pumped back into the pool.

So the reward is 0.15% fees of EVERY trade. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",117403698073698310

13284,926615689907798066,"Firstly NFT holders get 1% of LFNTY token which will be dropped once a week over 52 weeks to wallets where NFTs are not listed. But the buyback NFTs will not qualify either.

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool so it's fees per trade pumped back into the pool.

So the reward is 0.15% fees of EVERY trade. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15% fees of EVERY trade. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

So all the mint fees of 15k sol go to the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k sol worth of USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

14387,926173250118115429,"This is my take

So the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

There will ALWAYS be fees from the lp pool to buy the nfts regardless of the fees from nft sales.

This integration with Jupiter is massive. As lifinity fees are lowest out there at 0.15% anytime anyone hits Jupiter to trade it should hit lifinity being the lowest fees and always having the liquidity available by it's design to concentrate liquidity. 

Pretty much anyone I know on solana is using Jupiter by default now as it checks over 400 routes to get you the user the best price.

Next time anyone here who has not used jup.ag I suggest you try it. You won't go back.",810247348802289695

14553,926126199346966529,"This is my take



So the DAO wallet with 7.5k SOL and 7.5k USD will fully shake into the pool. 

There are no tokens emitted as a reward as per constant curve type AMMs like Raydium Farm or fusion pool. This will be equivalent to raydium permissionless pool. 

So the reward is 0.15%. So if you have 1000 usdc to exchange to sol the fee will be 1.5 usdc and vica versa it will be 0.15% of Sol if swapping the other way. So the DAO wallet lp token appreciates in value as portion of fees are added up into it. Team will likley take a snap shot of lp token Value each week and cash out the delta, then add to 5% royalty from the nft secondary sales and then split. Then half is used for buyback of NFTs and half is put back into LP pool and the cycle continues.",810247348802289695

16039,925555735688003586,so could matter to an individual but has no impact on buybacks or utility,200306626928836619
16040,925555688132972605,someone bought ID #1 (not even rank) for 70 SOL,200306626928836619
16041,925555645799878697,that being said,200306626928836619
16042,925555638048804894,rarity has no impact on utility,200306626928836619
16043,925555275019214899,So owning a basic seems like tbr play,822534562395586602
16044,925555210624073748,Basically holding gets you the benefit and worst case protocol not paying more for rare correct ?,822534562395586602
16045,925555079988248698,And is rarity a big deal here or no,822534562395586602
16046,925554666534740038,minimum downside is whatever price you buy - 0.75 SOL,200306626928836619
16047,925554446136664094,which is better because the percentage of tokens you get increases as floor gets bought back,200306626928836619
16048,925554440885399552,Ok so someone with a bigger brain give me a best case scenario here,822534562395586602
16049,925554288078516224,over a year the tokens will be airdropped,200306626928836619
16050,925554232621416448,"and as more and more nfts are taken out of circulation, those 50% still are dedicated to buy backs so you will be able to exit, its not like there will be 0 volume to liquidate ur nft if you wanted to",200306626928836619
16051,925554184567279677,And nft holders will routinely get airdrops of the token or only a one time fraction of the 1% allocation ?,822534562395586602

16057,925553958783709234,these will be used to buyback the floor effectively taking those nfts out of circulation and increasing the amount of tokens airdropped to each holder,200306626928836619
16058,925553942820175872,And the dao buys floor ?,822534562395586602

Floor that is bought back goes into holdings for the DAO made of NFT holders. The DAO decides what is done with the nfts that are bought back.

22519,925031690781487124,i agree with this. Allocating more % could be better for all of us and even the devs,249946742051569664

They also have much less competition: basically Arweave and filecoin.   For this project to be successful the dex has to be successful which is a more competitive market but with potentially higher margins from my understanding.

22720,925022334635610173,"Here is my take on the nft price, most of the people that minted are not looking to sell anytime soon, nor do they care about the price of the nft. Its all about the revenue that those nfts will generate over the year +! There is a reason somebody bought 1150 of them and didn't flip 12h later for 3x. If anything, we should be happy price stays reasonable and that causes people to buy and sell which generates royalties that go directly to pool and buybacks. So i guess what I'm saying is there are 2 games being played, somebody wants to flip for a short term gains, and somebody is not even looking at ME. Most nfts are not going to be sold anytime soon, so this obsession with floor being at 4 or 8 SOL is mostly irrelevant for now.",393496265796747264

"" People do not understand this enough. DEX is
a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep
paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other
DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides
concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very
soon be able to expand to many other trading
pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which
solves the problem of the massive value leak
from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an
enormous amount of money for the protocol
and will only get more obvious when it expands
to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised
High Frequency Market Maker at the same
time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto
Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at
the same time, hence making both the trading
fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread.

1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.",917977969379672095

28429,924845033683845120,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.",893864466209460224

32684,924786151661895760,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.",850988172162236426

32693,924785924515168337,"long story short:

lifinity remediates a key issue in defi called impermanence loss.

Impermance loss occurs when users lose the tokens they stake when they provide liquidity.

Lifinity prevents this by being proactive when using their algorithm as a proactive dex rather than a standard active dex like uniswap

This fixes a very key problem in defi and is a major reason large investors avoid defi.

to better understand impermanent loss, heres a very simple and short video:

1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread.

32969,924781615471792218,There are a couple of more visible points where your NFT could accrue value. One is that NFT holders get a stake of the 1% of LFNTY governance token in the future. The next is that revenue funds are directly used to buy back NFTs from the secondary markets (at some undetermined time interval). It could be a very nice circular spiral upwards utilizing that mechanism. Timeline to see it all play out is likely 6 months as it seems the base protocol has been at least created. I don't know how much of it is still being stress tested in testnet.,384731134682071041
32970,924781613030707210,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time.

33566,924773412956688395,""" People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.""",834423579177123910

33664,924772037900271666,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.""",834423579177123910

33778,924770297092137070,""" People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.""",834423579177123910

33955,924768282425298954,""" People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.""",834423579177123910

""People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.""",817007741965041706

35380,924745970703544320,"People do not understand this enough. DEX is a competitive business, but Lifinity
1. Has its own liquidity so will not need to keep paying to rent liquidity (primary reason other DEX fail)
2. Way more capital efficient (provides concentrated liquidity), meaning it will very soon be able to expand to many other trading pairs, dramatically increasing revenue.
3. Uses oracles to provide liquidity, which solves the problem of the massive value leak from LP to arbitrageurs. This saves an enormous amount of money for the protocol and will only get more obvious when it expands to more products.
4. It is not just a DEX. It is also a decentralised High Frequency Market Maker at the same time. The protocol fills both the role of a Crypto Exchange and a Crypto market making firm at the same time, hence making both the trading fee revenue, as well as the bid-ask spread. Think of the protocol being a decentralised version of FTX and Alameda Research at the same time. These are some of the most profitable businesses in crypto, and now there is a decentralised version which we can own as a community.",440911828063617024

36017,924731392435322910,"Here is what NFT holders get from what I understood.

1. All the Royalty Fees (5% of Secondary sales)
2. Trading Fees from the 15,000 SOL Liquidity Pool 
     - 50% Goes to Buy Back NFTs with fewer NFTs and higher floor price 
     - 50% Adds to Liquidity Pool 
3. 1% Token to NFT Holders. 

In my mind, this is great from Tax Perspective. NFT holders get to decide when the tax event happens - short vs long term. In the mean time, NFT Floor Price will go up and Liquidity Pool will go up providing more trading fees. Magic of Compounding at work with out tax implications until you are ready. 

Am I missing something?

38159,923115215959261215,hmm maybe we have different comfort levels here with ML.  generally speaking there's a lot I trust it to be more accurate with.  but I'm actually more interested in what you guys are doing.  was just trying to get an understanding of competition,834482952590721094

38734,916007404343267358,"Is it though? The mechanism is straightforward; put funds in a DEX to provide liquidity, use trading fees and royalties on NFT marketplaces to buy back. There's no wishful thinking here or making promises that can't be fulfilled. I think what might be causing a reaction in you is that the mechanism is so generous toward the buyers. This is not common among other projects, and I understand how that could give you pause. But I don't know what else to tell you. Skepticism is healthy, but only up to a certain point. If things feel too unclear for you to participate, that's fine! You can always buy off of the secondary market once you feel you've confirmed we're not a rug.
